# KNN-to-Predict-Heart-Failure
This project is to fulfill the course of Data Mining Project.
The project is to predict whether a patient has heart failure using one of the most popular machine learning algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

The dataset is retrieved from this link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

The project will consist of 2 python files, one for the KNN model and one for the application.
The application is built using streamlit.
